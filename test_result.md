Backend API works perfectly (confirmed via direct testing - returns website_opened: true and correct YouTube URL). Manual navigation works (window.location.href successfully navigates to YouTube). However, the React form submission is not sending /api/chat requests when user clicks send button. Root cause: React context missing dependencies (aiContextAvailable: false, axiosAvailable: false) and form submission handler not executing properly. The chat input accepts text and send button is functional, but onClick handler fails to trigger API calls.
