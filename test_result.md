- Ensure cross-browser compatibility

## Incorporate User Feedback
- User provided Groq API key for AI integration
- Focus on all three core features: browser + AI + workflow automation
- Prioritize exact UI/UX matching with Fellou.ai
- Ensure performance and robustness match original

## üöÄ CRITICAL UI COMPONENT FIXES - (Aug 21, 2025)

### ‚úÖ ISSUES RESOLVED:
1. **‚úÖ Fellou Assistant button** - Now fully functional and visible in navigation bar
2. **‚úÖ Control/Customization menu (three dots)** - Properly accessible with dropdown menu
3. **‚úÖ AI sidebar with close button (X)** - Working correctly with toggle functionality

### üîß FIX IMPLEMENTED:
- **Root Cause**: App was using simplified MainContent.js component instead of full BrowserInterface.js

- **File Modified**: `/app/frontend/src/components/EnhancedApp.js`
- **Result**: All UI components now function as expected with proper Fellou.ai clone behavior

### üìà UI COMPONENT STATUS: **FULLY FUNCTIONAL** ‚úÖ
- Fellou Assistant button: **WORKING** ‚úÖ
- Control menu (three dots): **WORKING** ‚úÖ  
- AI sidebar close button: **WORKING** ‚úÖ
- React app mounting: **WORKING** ‚úÖ

1. ‚úÖ FIXED: External URL access ("Invalid Host header" resolved)
2. Complete basic browser interface setup
3. Integrate Groq AI for chat functionality
4. Implement workflow processing system
5. Add cross-platform integration capabilities

## üöÄ CRITICAL BUG FIX - External URL Access
- **Issue**: "Invalid Host header" error when accessing external URL
- **Root Cause**: React dev server host header validation blocking external domains
- **Fix Applied**: 
  * Added DANGEROUSLY_DISABLE_HOST_CHECK=true to .env files
  * Updated package.json start script
  * Created .env.local with proper host configuration
  * Fixed missing httpcore dependency in backend
- **Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - App now accessible via external URLs
- **Verification**: Both frontend (port 3000) and backend (port 8001) working properly
