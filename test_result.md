# Emergent.ai - Fellou.ai Clone Development

## Project Overview
Building an exact clone of Fellou.ai - the world's first agentic browser with Deep Action technology, cross-platform integration, and AI-powered workflow automation.

## Original User Problem Statement
Build an AI-powered browser as a perfect and exact clone of fellou.ai - matching AI Abilities, UI/UX, Workflow & Page Structure, performance, optimization, robustness, App Usage Simplicity, and browsing abilities.

## Current Development Status
- **Phase**: Foundation Setup & Core Browser Interface
- **Tech Stack**: React + FastAPI + MongoDB + Groq AI
- **API Key**: Groq API configured (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)

5. ⏳ **Cross-Platform Integration (50+ platforms)**
6. ⏳ **Timeline & Multi-task Management**
7. ⏳ **Drag & Drop Workflow Builder**
8. ⏳ **AI Report Generation**
9. ⏳ **Split View & Groups/Spaces**
10. ⏳ **Credit System & Monetization**

## Development Phases
### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- [x] Project structure setup
- [x] Browser-like UI with address bar and tabs
- [x] AI chat sidebar integration
- [x] Basic navigation and web content display

### Phase 2: Core AI Features  
- [x] Natural language command processing
- [x] Multi-step workflow execution
- [x] Background task processing
- [ ] Shadow window simulation

### Phase 3: Advanced Integration
- [ ] Cross-platform API integrations
- [ ] Web scraping capabilities
- [ ] Automated report generation
- [ ] Timeline and multi-task switching

## Testing Protocol
### Backend Testing Guidelines
- Use `deep_testing_backend_v2` for comprehensive API testing
- Test AI integration endpoints thoroughly
- Validate workflow execution reliability
- Monitor performance benchmarks

### Frontend Testing Guidelines  
- Ask user before frontend testing using `ask_human` tool
- Test browser interface responsiveness
- Validate AI chat integration
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility

## Incorporate User Feedback
- User provided Groq API key for AI integration
- Focus on all three core features: browser + AI + workflow automation
- Prioritize exact UI/UX matching with Fellou.ai
- Ensure performance and robustness match original

## Next Steps
1. Complete basic browser interface setup
2. Integrate Groq AI for chat functionality
3. Implement workflow processing system
4. Add cross-platform integration capabilities
